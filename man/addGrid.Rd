  col = "grey30", 
  lty = 3)
}
\arguments{
  \item{linesPerTick}{ Number of lines between successive tick marks (including the line on the
tickmarks themselves). }
  \item{linesPerTick.horiz}{ Number of horizontal lines between successive tick marks (including the line on the
tickmarks themselves). }
  \item{linesPerTick.vert}{ Number of vertical lines between successive tick marks (including the line on the
tickmarks themselves). }
  \item{horiz}{ Draw horizontal grid lines? }
  \item{vert}{ Draw vertical tick lines? }
  \item{col}{ Specifies color of the grid lines }
  \item{lty}{ Specifies line type of grid lines. See \code{\link{par}}. }
